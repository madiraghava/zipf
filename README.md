**An Overview of the Pareto Principle and Zipf’s Law**

The Pareto Principle, colloquially known as the 80/20 rule is a common adage

used in various, generally unrelated, contexts. Wikipedia defines the Pareto Principle as

the idea that “for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of

causes” - for instance, in the business world, a mere 20% of customers are responsible

for 80% of sales.


Zipf’s Law, on a related note, is usually introduced in the context of words in a

language. It has long been observed that a word’s frequency is proportional to how

often it is used in relation to other words. For instance the second most common word is

used about half as often as the most common word, the third most common word is

used a third as often, etc. Not only does this bafflingly apply to language, it also applies

to a plethora of phenomena such as the diameter of moon craters, the rate at which we

forget, and even the firing patterns of neural networks.

**The inspiration for this project was to examine whether Zipf’s law was applicable**

**to systems of people and how they interact with each other.** This would require a

few different things - a way to examine people’s natural interactions in a natural system

at scale, and an unambiguous way to examine this data. The full write-up is present in the repository.
